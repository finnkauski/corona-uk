# Corona case and death tracker (UK)

Very simple script to track the number of cases and deaths in the UK. I have decided to cut down how much news I read at this difficult time so this is a way for me to still keep in the loop a little bit.

Outputs: `ðŸ¤’ 5,018 (1,035 new) ðŸ’€ 233 (56 new)`

It just nicely wraps the live updates from [here](https://corona-stats.online/UK?source=2). Thank you to Luke Smith (YouTuber) for the idea.

## Usage

The script will run out of the box just by running `bash ./corona.sh` or by turning it into an executable. 

**Extra commands**:
`corona full` - prints the outputs of the curl to the website.

## Stay safe everyone.
