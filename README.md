# Corona case and death tracker (UK)

Very simple script to track the number of cases and deaths in the UK. 

Outputs: `ğŸ¤’ 5,018 (1,035 new) ğŸ’€ 233 (56 new)`

It just nicely wraps the live updates from [here](https://corona-stats.online/UK?source=2). Thank you to Luke Smith (YouTuber) for the idea.

## Stay safe everyone.
